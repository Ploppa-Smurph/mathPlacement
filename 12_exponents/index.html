<h2>12.01 - Adding and Subtracting Polynomials</h2>
    - Review combining like terms
                ex: <i>-4p^7 + 8p^7 + 5p^9</i>
                    = 4p^7 + 5p^9
                    = 5p^9 + 4p^7

                ex02: <i>-4y^2 + 3y^2 - 2y^2 + y^2</i> 
                    = -2y^2

    - Know vocabulary for polynomials 
                a polynomial in <i>x</i> is a term, or a finite sum of terms, of the form <i>ax^n</i>,
                  for any real number <i>a</i> and any whole number <i>n</i>.

                a polynomial is written in descending powers (higest power first) from left to right.
                    ex: <i>6x^8 - 7x^6 + 5x^4 - 3x^2 + 4</i>
                        you sort based in descending order
                        
                the <b>degree of a term</b> is the sum of the exponents on the variables

                the <b>degree of a polynomial</b> is the highest degree of anynonzero term of the polynomial
                    ex: (2x^2)*y = 2x^2*y has a degree of 3 --> 2x's + 1y = 3
                    ex02: 3x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 has a degree of 4 --> since this is a polynomial - you use the highest degree and it is 4 for this example

                monomial = polynomial with only a single (1) term:
                    ex: <i>9m</i> or <i>-6y^5</i>

                binomial = polynomial with exactly 2 terms: 
                    ex: <i>-9x^4 + 9x^3</i> or <i>8m^2 + 6m</i>

                trinomial = polynomial with exactly 3 terms: 
                    ex: <i>9m^3 - 4m^2 + 6</i>   -- 3 terms             
            
            ex: <i>6x^4 - 9x</i>  --> this is a binomial that is already in descending order
                                         the <b>degree</b> for this binomial is 4 (the highest exponent)
                                       
            ex02: <i>5m^4 - 3m^2 + 6m^5 - 7m^3</i> 
                    6m^5 + 5m^4 - 7m^3 - 3m^2  --> this has more than 3 terms and is simply polynomial (this has 4 polynomials)
                                                    the <b>degree</b> for this polynomial is 5 (the highest exponent)                            

                

    - Evaluate polynomials
        ex: find the value of <i>3x^4 + 5x^3 - 4x - 4</i> if x = -2
               3(-2^4) + 5(-2^3) - 4(-2) - 4
               3*16 + 5(-8) + 8 - 4
               48 - 40 + 8 - 4 = 12

        ex02: find the value of the polynomial
                <i>2x^2 + 5x + 1</i> when x = 2
                2*(2)^2 + 5(2) + 1
                2(4) + 10 + 1 = 19    -- this is a trinomial with a degree of 2
