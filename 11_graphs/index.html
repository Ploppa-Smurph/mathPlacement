<h1>Pearson Math Course ch 11: Reading Graphs: Linear Equations in Two Variables</h1>
<pre>
<h2>11.01 Reading Graphs: Linear Equations in Two Variables</h2>
            - Interpret Graphs
                look at bargraph and compare values
                 a) name the top two egg producing states, estimate their production:
                    ohio and iowa, 18 billion eggs produced total
                 b) which state had the least production, what is it's production?
                    north carolina; 2.5 billino pairs  
             
              linear equation with 2 variables can be written: 
               <i>Ax + By = C</i>  -- A and B != 0      

            - Write a solution as an ordered pair
                (x, y) -- put the solution as an ordered pair, then you know where to fill in terms in equation
                                  
                ex: y = 3x + 4
                    y = 3(2) + 4
                    y = 10 
                    ordered pair for this would look like = (2, 10) (x, y)  

            - Decide whether a given ordered pair is a solution of a given equation
                ex: x + y = 8     --> fill in with ordered pair (0, 8)   
                      this is true, 0 + 8 = 8

                ex02: 5x - 3y = 15   --> given ordered pair (5, 2)
                      5(5) - 3(2) = 15
                      25 - 6 != 15   
                      this is false, 25 - 6 != 15      

            - Complete ordered pairs for a given equation
                ex: y = 2x + 7     (5, ?)  -- solve for 'y' using 'x' provided
                    y = 2(5) + 7
                    y = 17         (5, 17) will be the solution  

            - Complete a table of values
                often ordered pairs fill in table values

            - Plot ordered pairs
                cartesian quadinate system -- x and y axis 
                  Quadrant I   - all plot points are positive (+x, +y)
                  Quadrant II  - plot points are x is negative, y is positive (-x, +y)
                  Quadrant III - x plot point is negative, y is negative (-x,-y)
                  Quadrant IV  - x point is positive, y point is negative (+x, -y)

                point (0,0) is the 'origin' of the quadrants

        ex: table shows rate at which 4 year college students graduate within 5 yrs
             in this example they want the 'years' to be the 'x' coordinate
                                            'rate' to be the 'y' coordinate
                                           
<h2>11.02 Graphing Linear Equations in Two Variables</h2>
        - Graph linear equation by plotting ordered pair
            ex: complete given ordered pairs for equation. graph them:
               <i>y = 2/3x + 1</i>  (0, ); (3, ); (-3, )
                 1st - y = 2/3(0) + 1  ==>  y = 1
                 2nd - y = 2/3(3) + 1  ==>  y = 3
                 3rd - y = 2/3(-3) + 1 ==>  y = -1

                 points will be: (0, 1); (3, 3); (-3, 1)

        - Find intercepts
             to find 'x' intercept: set 'y' as 0 and solve to find the x intercept
             to find 'y' intercept: sex 'x' as 0
              ex: find intercepts for graph: <i>2x + y = 4</i>
                  2x + 0 = 4
                  x = 2          => x intercept (2, 0)
                  2(0) + y = 4
                  y = 4          => y intercept (0, 4)

        - Graph linear equations where the intercepts coincide
           both intercepts share the same point 
            ex: y = -6x
                0 = -6x          => x intercept (0, 0)
                y = -6(0)
                y = 0            => y intercept (0, 0)
              simply solve for 2 more points on the line and you can graph
               y = -6(-1)
               y = 6             => 2nd point (-1, 6)
               y = -6(1)
               y = -6            => 3rd point (1, -6)

        - Graph linear equations of the form:
           <i>y = k</i> or <i>x = k</i>
           in these examples the value of x or y is constant
           ex: y = -4; for any value of x, y is always -4
                 * it is a straight line (horizontal)

           ex02: x - 3 = 0     => x intercept is 3, and will always be 3
                 build a value chart / table:   x - y
                                                3   0 
                                                3   5
                                                3  -5
                 * value will be vertical line                               

        - Use linear equation to model data 
            ex: the height (y) or a woman is related to the length of her radius bone(x)
                 (from the wrist to the elbow) and is approximated by the equation:
                <i>y = 3.9x + 73.5</i>
                solve for women with radius of 20cm, 22cm, and 26cm:
                y = 3.9(20cm) + 73.5      => (20, 151.5)cm
                y = 3.9(22cm) + 73.5      => (22, 159.3)cm
                y = 3.9(26cm) + 73.5      => (26, 174.9)cm
            part02: given woman's height (y) of 167cm, what is the length of the radius bone (x)         
                167cm = 3.9x + 73.5
                93.5cm = 3.9x
                x = 23.97 rounded to 24cm    (24, 167)cm
