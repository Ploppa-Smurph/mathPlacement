<h2>11.01 Reading Graphs: Linear Equations in Two Variables</h2>
            - Interpret Graphs
                look at bargraph and compare values
                 a) name the top two egg producing states, estimate their production:
                    ohio and iowa, 18 billion eggs produced total
                 b) which state had the least production, what is it's production?
                    north carolina; 2.5 billino pairs  
             
              linear equation with 2 variables can be written: 
               <i>Ax + By = C</i>  -- A and B != 0      

            - Write a solution as an ordered pair
                (x, y) -- put the solution as an ordered pair, then you know where to fill in terms in equation
                                  
                ex: y = 3x + 4
                    y = 3(2) + 4
                    y = 10 
                    ordered pair for this would look like = (2, 10) (x, y)  

            - Decide whether a given ordered pair is a solution of a given equation
                ex: x + y = 8     --> fill in with ordered pair (0, 8)   
                      this is true, 0 + 8 = 8

                ex02: 5x - 3y = 15   --> given ordered pair (5, 2)
                      5(5) - 3(2) = 15
                      25 - 6 != 15   
                      this is false, 25 - 6 != 15      

            - Complete ordered pairs for a given equation
                ex: y = 2x + 7     (5, ?)  -- solve for 'y' using 'x' provided
                    y = 2(5) + 7
                    y = 17         (5, 17) will be the solution  

            - Complete a table of values
                often ordered pairs fill in table values

            - Plot ordered pairs
                cartesian quadinate system -- x and y axis 
                  Quadrant I   - all plot points are positive (+x, +y)
                  Quadrant II  - plot points are x is negative, y is positive (-x, +y)
                  Quadrant III - x plot point is negative, y is negative (-x,-y)
                  Quadrant IV  - x point is positive, y point is negative (+x, -y)

                point (0,0) is the 'origin' of the quadrants

        ex: table shows rate at which 4 year college students graduate within 5 yrs
             in this example they want the 'years' to be the 'x' coordinate
                                            'rate' to be the 'y' coordinate
