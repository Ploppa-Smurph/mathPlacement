<h2>10.01 - Addition Property of Equality</h2>
        - Identify linear equations
              ex: <i>Ax + B = C</i>
                    ** <i>A</i> != 0 in this example

        - Use the addition property of equality
            if <i>A</i>,<i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> are real numbers then:
              <i>A = B</i> and <i>A + C = B + C</i> are equivalent equations

            ex: x + 26 = 17
                x + 26 - 26 = 17 - 26
                x = -9   soulution set = {-9}
                
            ex02: -2 = x - 12
                  -2 + 12 = x - 12 + 12
                  10 = x   solution set = {10}     

        - Simplify equations and then use the addition property of equality 
            ex: 2/5w - 6 = 7/5w 
                -2/5w + 2/5w - 6 = -2/5w + 7/5w
                -6 = 5/5w
                -6 = w 
                the solution set is {-6}
                
            ex02: -2(8p + 2) - 3(2 - 7p) - 2(4 + 2p) = 0
                    -16p - 4 - 6 + 21p - 8 - 4p = 0
                    -16p - 4 + 21p - 4 - 6 - 8 = 0
                    p = 18

            ex03: 2(p + 5) - (9 + p) = -3
                   2p + 10 - 9 - p = -3
                   p + 1 = -3
                   p = -2

            ex04: six times a number is subtracted from seven times the number the result is -9; find <i>x</i>
                      7x - 6x = -9
                      x = -9

<h2>10.2 - Multiplication Property of Equality</h2>
            - Use the multiplication of equality
                if <i>A = B</i> and C != 0; then <i>AC = BC</i>

                ex: 3a = -15
                     a = -5

                ex02: 10t = -36
                    t = -3.6

                ex03: x/7 = -5
                      x = -35   

                ex04: -5/6t = -15
                      -6/5 * -5/6t = -6/5 * -15
                      t = -6/5 * -15/1 =  90/5 
                      t = 18  
                      
                ex05: 2/7p = 4
                      7/2 * 2/7 p = 7/2 * 4
                      p = 7/2 * 4/1
                      p = 14

            - Simplify equations and then use the multiplication property of equlity
                ex: 5m + 6m - 2m = 63
                    9m = 63
                    m = 7 

                ex02: when a number is multiplied by 4 the result is 6.
                      4x = 6
                      x = 6/4
                      x = 1 1/2 (1.5)
