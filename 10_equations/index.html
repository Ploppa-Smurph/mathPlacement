<h2>10.01 - Addition Property of Equality</h2>
        - Identify linear equations
              ex: <i>Ax + B = C</i>
                    ** <i>A</i> != 0 in this example

        - Use the addition property of equality
            if <i>A</i>,<i>B</i>, and <i>C</i> are real numbers then:
              <i>A = B</i> and <i>A + C = B + C</i> are equivalent equations

            ex: x + 26 = 17
                x + 26 - 26 = 17 - 26
                x = -9   soulution set = {-9}
                
            ex02: -2 = x - 12
                  -2 + 12 = x - 12 + 12
                  10 = x   solution set = {10}     

        - Simplify equations and then use the addition property of equality 
            ex: 2/5w - 6 = 7/5w 
                -2/5w + 2/5w - 6 = -2/5w + 7/5w
                -6 = 5/5w
                -6 = w 
                the solution set is {-6}
                
            ex02: -2(8p + 2) - 3(2 - 7p) - 2(4 + 2p) = 0
                    -16p - 4 - 6 + 21p - 8 - 4p = 0
                    -16p - 4 + 21p - 4 - 6 - 8 = 0
                    p = 18

            ex03: 2(p + 5) - (9 + p) = -3
                   2p + 10 - 9 - p = -3
                   p + 1 = -3
                   p = -2

            ex04: six times a number is subtracted from seven times the number the result is -9; find <i>x</i>
                      7x - 6x = -9
                      x = -9

<h2>10.2 - Multiplication Property of Equality</h2>
            - Use the multiplication of equality
                if <i>A = B</i> and C != 0; then <i>AC = BC</i>

                ex: 3a = -15
                     a = -5

                ex02: 10t = -36
                    t = -3.6

                ex03: x/7 = -5
                      x = -35   

                ex04: -5/6t = -15
                      -6/5 * -5/6t = -6/5 * -15
                      t = -6/5 * -15/1 =  90/5 
                      t = 18  
                      
                ex05: 2/7p = 4
                      7/2 * 2/7 p = 7/2 * 4
                      p = 7/2 * 4/1
                      p = 14

            - Simplify equations and then use the multiplication property of equlity
                ex: 5m + 6m - 2m = 63
                    9m = 63
                    m = 7 

                ex02: when a number is multiplied by 4 the result is 6.
                      4x = 6
                      x = 6/4
                      x = 1 1/2 (1.5)
                
<h2>10.3 - More on Solving Linear Equations</h2>
            -  Lean and use the four steps for solving linear equations
                1) Simplify each side separately: 
                     clear parentheses, fractions, and decimals, using the distributive property as needed
                2) Isolate the variable term on one side: 
                     use addition property so that the variable term is on one side of the equation
                3) Isolate the variable: 
                     use multiplication property to isolate the variable from any coefficient 
                4) Check:
                     verify the solution correctly solves the equation                  
            ex: 4(k-3)-k = k-6
                4k - 12 -k = k-6
                3k -12 = k-6
                2k = 6
                k = 3

            ex02: 3/4x - 1/3x + 5 = 5/6x
                  12(3/4x -1/3x +5) = 12(5/6x)
                  9x - 4x + 60 = 10x
                  5x + 60 = 10x
                  60 = 5x
                  x = 12
                  solution set = {12}

        - Solve equations with fraction or decimal coefficients
            ex: 0.3(30) + 0.15x = 0.2(30 + x)
                100(.3(30)+ 0.15x) = 100[0.2(30 + x)]
                30(30) + 15x = 20(30 + 100x)
                900 + 15x = 600 + 20x
                300 = 5x
                60 = x

        - Solve equations that have no solution / infinitely many solutions 
            true statement = {all real numbers} solution set 
               ex: work a equation and all variables cancel out, left with solution 5 = 5; 
                 5 = 5 is true, but all the variables are canceled out so the solution set is {all real numbers}
               ex02: 5x - 15 = 5(x-3)
                     5x - 15 = 5x - 15
                     -15 = -15      {all real numbers}

            false statement = 0
               ex: work the equation and solution is 2 = 3; 2 can never = 3 so it is false 
               ex02: 2x + 3(x+1) = 5x + 4
                     2x + 3x + 3 = 5x + 4
                     5x + 3 = 5x + 4
                     3 = 4          {false} = 0 (without solution set)

        - Write expressions for two related unknown quantities
            ex: two numbers have a sum of 23. if one of the numbers is represented by k write an expression for the other numbers:
                23 - k
            

<h2>10.6 - Solving Linear Inequalities</h2>
        Inequalities are: <, <=, >, >=
           include sets of solutions, not just 1 number  

        - Graph intervals on a number line
                ex: k <= 4      -- solution set = (-infinity - +4] - set includes '4' and all numbers lower than it

                ex02: 0 < y <= 10 -- solution set = (0 - 10] -- parenthesis by the 0 because it doesn't include 0
                                                                bracket by the 10 because 10 is included

        - Use addition property of inequality
                   <i>A < B</i> also <i>A + C < B + C</i>
                ex: 
     
        - Use mulitplication property of inequality
     
        - Solve linear inequalities by using properties of inequality
     
        - Solve applied problems using inequalities\

        - Solve linear inequalities with three parts
