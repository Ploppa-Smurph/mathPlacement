<h1>Math Placement 09 - the Real Number System</h1>  
<pre>  
<h3>9.1 working on Order of Operations, Exponents, and Inequality</h3>
       completed area - learned about programming operators (+, -, =, <, >, <=, >=, !=) 

<h3>9.2 Variables, Expressions, and Equations</h3>
      completed area - learned about variables 

<h3>9.3 Real Numbers and the Number Line</h3>
        - use integers to express numbers in applications 
        - graph rational numbers on number line
        - tell which of 2 real numbers is less than the other
        - find opposite of real number
        - find absolute value of real number 

<h3>9.4 Adding Real Numbers</h3>
            - add numbers with the same sign
                ex: using # line; find 2 + 3... end up at 5 on the # line
                ex02: find -7 + (-3) = -10... end up at -10 on the # line

            - add numbers with different signs

            - add mentally

            - use order of operators with real numbers

            - translate words and phrases that indicate addition
              sum
              added to
              more than
              increased by
              plus

<h3>9.5 Subtracting Real Numbers</h3>
        - find the difference

        - using the definition of subtraction
             for any real number <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>,
               <i>a - b = a + (-b)</i>

        - work subtraction problems that involve brackets

        - translate words and phrases that indicate subtraction

<h3>9.6 Multiplying and Dividing Real Numbers</h3>
        - find the product of numbers with different signs
            product of '+' and '-' = negative '-'
        
        - find product of 2 negative numbers
            product of 2 negative nubers is positive 
        
        - use reciprocal of a number to apply the definition of division
            the quotient of <i>a/b</i> or real numbers <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> (where <i>b</i> != 0)
                <i>a/b - a * 1/b</i>
                ex: -1/8 / (-3/4) = -1/8 * (-4/3) = 4/24 = 1/6 
        
        - use the order of operations when multiplying and dividing signed numbers
            ex: -10(2)+6(2) / -3-(-1) = -20+12 / -3+1 = -8/-2 = 4
        
        - evaluate expressions involving variables
            ex: x= -1, y= -2, m= -3;
               (3x + 4y)(-2m)
               (3*-1 + 4*-2)(-2*-3)
               (-3 + -8)(6)
               (-11)(6) = -66 
        
        - translate words and phrases involving multiplication and division

        
        - translate simple sentences into equations
