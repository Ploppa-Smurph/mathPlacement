<h1>Math Placement 09 - the Real Number System</h1>  
<pre>  
<h3>9.1 working on Order of Operations, Exponents, and Inequality</h3>
       completed area - learned about programming operators (+, -, =, <, >, <=, >=, !=) 

<h3>9.2 Variables, Expressions, and Equations</h3>
      completed area - learned about variables 

<h3>9.3 Real Numbers and the Number Line</h3>
        - use integers to express numbers in applications 
        - graph rational numbers on number line
        - tell which of 2 real numbers is less than the other
        - find opposite of real number
        - find absolute value of real number 

<h3>9.4 Adding Real Numbers</h3>
            - add numbers with the same sign
                ex: using # line; find 2 + 3... end up at 5 on the # line
                ex02: find -7 + (-3) = -10... end up at -10 on the # line

            - add numbers with different signs

            - add mentally

            - use order of operators with real numbers

            - translate words and phrases that indicate addition
              sum
              added to
              more than
              increased by
              plus

<h3>9.5 Subtracting Real Numbers</h3>


<h3>9.6 Multiplying and Dividing Real Numbers</h3>

<h3>9.7 Properties of Real Numbers</h3>

<h3>9.8 Simplifying Expressions</h3>
