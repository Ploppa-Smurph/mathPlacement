<h3>13.01 Factors: the Greatest Common Factor</h3>
        - <b>Find Greatest Common Factor of a list of numbers</b>
         ex: 40, 20, 4
                40 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 5
                20 = 2 * 2 * 5
                4  = 2 * 2
            gcf = (2 *2) -- all the numbers share 2 * 2 = 4

         ex02: 4, 9, 12
               4  = 2 * 2       
               9  = 3 * 3
               12 = 2 * 2 * 3
            gcf = 1 (no other factors shared between all 3)

        - <b>Find Greatest Common Factor of a list of variable terms</b>
         ex: 16y, 24 
            16y = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * y
            24  = 2 * 2 * 2 * 3
            gcf = 2 * 2 * 2  = 8
        
         ex02: -x^4 * y^3, -x * y^2
             gcf = xy^2    ===> xy^2 goes into both of the variable terms  
        
         ex03: 42ab^3, -36a, 90b, -48ab
               42ab^3 = 2 * 3 * 7 * a * b^3
               -36a   = -1 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * a 
                90b   = 2 * 3 * 3 * 5 * b
               -48ab  = -1 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * a * b
             gcf = 2 * 3 
             gcf = 6
        
        <b>Steps for finding GCF (Greatest Common Factor)</b>
            1) Factor - write each number in prime factored form
            2) List Common Factors - list each prime number, or variable, that is a factor of every term
                    (if a prime does not appear in one of the factored forms then it cannot appear in the greatest common factor)
            3) Choose smallest exponents - use as exponents on the common prime factors the smalles exponents from the prime factored forms        
            4) Multiply - multiply the primes from step 3, if no primes available the greatest common factor = 1

        - <b>Factor out the greatest common factor</b>
            ex: x^2 - 4x
               gcf = x
               x^2 - 4x = x(x - 4)
            
            ex02: 4x^3 - 10x^2 + 6x
             gcf = 2x
             2x(2x^2 - 5x + 3)  

            ex03: c(x + 2) + d(x + 2)
              gcf = (x + 2)
              (c + d)(x + 2)   

        - <b>Factor by grouping</b>
            ex: 2x + 6 + ax + 3a
                (2x + 6) + (ax + 3a)
                2(x + 3) + a(x +3)
                (x + 3)(2 + a) -- you can check using FOIL method
                First:  2x
                Outer:  ax
                Inner:  6
                Last :  3a

            ex02: 2x^2 - 10x + 3xy - 15y
                  (2x^2 - 10x) + (3xy - 15y)
                  2x(x - 5) + 3y(x - 5)
                  (2x + 3y)(x - 5) 

<h3>13.02 Factoring Trinomials</h3>
    - <b>Factor trinomials with a coefficient of 1 for the squared term</b>
        (x + m)(x + n) = x^2 + nx + mx + mn
        = x^2 + x(m + n) + mn  
        = (x + m)(x + n)
        
        ex: m^2 + 9m + 14
        (m + 7)(m + 2)

        ex02: x^2 - 9x + 20
        (x - 5)(x - 4) 

        ex03: z^2 - 15z + 56
        (z - 8)(z - 7)  

        ex:04 p^2 - 2p - 15
        (p + 3)(p - 5)   

        ex05: x^2 - 5x + 12   is prime 
        no factors are shared between -5 and 12

        1) Both integers must be positive if the last term is positive
        2) Both integers must be negative if the last term is positive and the middle term is negative
        3) One integer must be positive and one integer must be negative is the last term is negative 
   
        ex06: z^2 - 2bz - 3b^2
        (z + b)(z - 3b)

    - <b>Factor such trinomials after factoring out the greatest common factor</b>
        ex07: 4x^5 - 28x^4 + 40x^3
        4x^3(x^2 - 7x + 10)
        4x^3(x - 5)(x - 2)       

<h3>13.03 Factoring Trinomials by Grouping</h3>
    - <b>Factor trinomials by grouping when the coefficient of the squared term is != 1</b>
        ex: 6r^2 + r - 1
            (6r^2 - 2r) + (3r - 1)
            2r(3r-1) + 1(3r - 1)
            (2r + 1)(3r - 1)

        ex02: 12z^2 - 5z - 2   (multiply 12 * -2) = -24
              (12z^2 + 3z - 8z -2)   (look for factors of -24)
              (12z^2 + 3z) - (2 + 8z)
              3z(4z + 1) - 2(4z + 1)
              (3z - 2)(4z + 1) 

        ex03: 10m^2 + mn - 3n^2
              10m^2 + 6mn - 5mn -3n^2
              (10m^2 - 5mn) + (6mn - 3n^2)
              5m(2m - n) + 3n(2m - n)
              (5m + 3n)(2m - n)

        ex04: 2m^3 + 2m^2 - 40m
              2m(m^2 + m - 20)
              2m(m^2 + 5m -4m -20)
              2m(m(m+5) - 4(m+5))
              2m(m+5)(m - 4)

        ex05: 32z^5 - 20z^4 -12z^3
              4z^3(8z^2 - 5z -3)
              4z^3(8z^2 + 3z - 8z - 3)
              4z^3((8z^2 - 8z) + (3z - 3))
              4z^3(8z(z - 1) + 3(z - 1))
              4z^3(8z + 3)(z - 1)
          
<h3>13.04 Factoring Trinomials using FOIL</h3> 
    - <b>Factor trinomials using FOIL</b>
        ex: 6a^2 + 7ab - 20ab^2
             (3a - 4b)(2a + 5b)

        ex02: 8p^2 + 14p + 5
                 try (8p + 5)(p + 1)   -- inner and outer = 8p + 5p  = 13p   != 14p -- incorrect answer 
                 try (p + 5)(8p + 1)   -- inner and outer = 40p + 1p = 41p   != 14p -- incorrect answer 
              (4p + 5)(2p + 1)         -- inner and outer = 10p + 4p = 14p   == 14p -- CORRECT ANSWER

        ex03: 3a^2 + 10a + 7
              (3a + 7)(a + 1)  
              
        ex04: 10m^2 - 23m + 12
              (5m - 4)(2m - 3)    -- FOIL 1st = 10m^2; In = -8m; out = -15m; last = 12 

        ex05: 8x^2 + 6x - 9
              (2x + 3)(4x - 3)

        ex06: 6m^6n + 7m^5n^2 + 2m^4n^3
              m^4n(6m^2 + 7mn + 2n^2)
              m^4n(3m + 2n)(2m + n)

<h3>13.05 Special Factoring Techniques</h3>  
      - <b>Factor a difference of squares</b>
            (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 == formula product of addition and subtraction of same numbers 

            <b><i>a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)</i></b>

              1)both binomials must be sqares to work; 
                ie: x^2, 9y^2, 25 (5^2), 1 (1^2), m^2
              2)terms of the binomials must have different signs (one positive, one negative)
              
            ex: x^2 - 49 = 
                (x + 7)(x - 7) 

            ex02: z^2 - 9/16
                  (z + 3/4)(z - 3/4)

            ex03: x^2 - 8  -- prime polynomial
                     cannot factor -- 8 is not a square        

            ex04: p^2 + 16
                     cannot factor -- the 16 is positive 

            caution about removing common factors?

            ex05: 36x^2 - 16
                  4(9x^2 - 4)
                  4(3x + 2)(3x -2)

            ex06: p^4 - 256 === (p - 4)^4
                  (p^2 - 16)^2
                  (p^2 + 16)(p^2 - 16)
                  (p^2 + 16)[(p + 4)(p - 4)]
                     
      - <b>Factor a perfect square trinomial</b>
            
            ex: x^2 + 8x + 16 = 
                (x + 4)(x + 4)
                (x + 4)^2 

            ex02: x^2 + 6x + 36 -- NOT a perfect square trinomial 
                      6 + 6 would be 12x, not 6x like we are presented with here
                     
        <b><i>Rules for Factoring Perfect Square Trinomials</i></b>          
            <i>a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a + b)^2</i>  -- this is finding the sum
            <i>a^2 - 2ab + b^2 = (a - b)^2</i>  -- this is finding the difference 

            ex: w^2 + 2w + 1
                (w + 1)(w + 1) = (w + 1)^2   

            ex: x^2 - 8x + 16
                (x - 4)(x - 4) = (x - 4)^2
