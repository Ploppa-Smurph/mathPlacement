<h1>Pearson Math Course ch 16: Roots, Radicals, and Complex Numbers</h1>
<pre>
<h2>16.01 Evaluating Roots</h2>
        Pythagorean Therom
      - <b>Find Square Roots</b>
        ex: sqrt 9
             3 & -3 are the square roots of 9 
            
        square root symbol is the <i><b>'radical'</b></i> symbol,
           the number in the square root symbol is called the <i><b>'radicand'</b></i>
        the square root of a number is positive, unless there is a negative before the radical symbol 
       
        ex02: sqrt 49
                7

        ex03: - sqrt 144/121 
                - 12/11

        ex04: sqrt 19 
               you square the square root and end up with the radicand as the answer
              sqrt 19^2 = 19

        ex05: sqrt (3x^2 + 4)
              sqrt (3x^2 + 4)^2
              3x^2 + 4

      - <b>Decide whether a given root is rational, irrational, or not a real number</b>
        ex: sqrt -25      !=  -sqrt 25
             the sqrt of a negative number is not going to be a rational number -- 
               the square root of a negative number is different from a negative square root of a radicand
        
        ex02: sqrt 25  = rational = 5
        ex03: sqrt 29  = irrational = 5.??
        ex04: sqrt -29 = not a real number -- there is no rational number that will give a - sqrt result

      - <b>Find decimal approximations for irrational square roots</b>
        ex: - sqrt 300     -- use calculator 
               the answer is negative 
             - 17.3205 

      - <b>Use the Pythagorean forumula</b>
          <i>if C is the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle and A and B are the lengths of the two legs
             then A^2 + B^2 = C^2</i>

        ex: a^2 + b^2 = c^2
            8^2 + 15^2 = c^2
            64 + 225  = c^2
            c^2 = 289   
            c = 17  

        ex02: a^2 + b^2 = c^2
              a^2 + 60^2 = 100^2
              a^2 + 3600 = 10000
              a^2 = 6400
              a = 80

      - <b>Use the distance formula</b>
        <i> the distance between points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is 
            d = sqrt (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 </i>

        ex: find distance between (5, 7) & (1, 4)
            d = sqrt (1 - 5)^2 + (4 - 7)^2 
            d = sqrt (-4)^2  + (-3)^2
            d = sqrt 16 + 9
            d = sqrt 25
            d = 5 

      - <b>Find cube, fourth, and other roots</b>
       <i>the nth root of A =   n-rt A, the n is the 'index' / 'order' of the radical</i>

      ex: 3-rt 125 (cubed root of 125)
          = 5
      
      ex02: 3-rt -27 (cubed root of -27)
            = -3

      ex03: 4-rt 625 (4th root 625)
            = 5

      ex04: 5-rt -1024 (5th root of -1024)
            = -4
